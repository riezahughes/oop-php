# oop-php
A repository for me to get my head around OOP with at the moment, PHP. I could learn using any other language, but php is my goto in terms of creating applications.
# What this is:
This isn't anything fancy. Basically just going through files and storing them here for reference, so i can understand objects better and get more practice.
# What this isn't:
Good code lol
